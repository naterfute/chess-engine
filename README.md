# Chess Engine

A Project I wanted to work on because I feel like i'm just doing
the same thing over and over again and not gaining any new skills.

This project is what it says it is. An engine... for chess.
It plays, sometimes wins, and most importantly, is not cookie
cutter like the rest of my projects.
